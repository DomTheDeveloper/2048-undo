This repository studies extremal play in the continued 4×4 game: which boards
can occur, how quickly a target can be reached, and which claims can be checked
independently. It combines a browser demonstration with plain-text move
certificates, two independent replay paths, a Lean 4 formalization, and
state-space experiments. The manuscript is a research preprint, not a claim
of journal acceptance or peer review. The affiliation identifies the author
and does not imply institutional endorsement.

> **Scope.** A legal sequence of favorable tile spawns establishes possibility,
> not a strategy that wins for every random or adversarial spawn sequence.
> The project does not claim to have solved the stochastic 4×4 game, counted
> every reachable 4×4 board, or attained the unrestricted maximum-score bound.

## Principal results and evidence

A **round** is one board-changing slide followed by one legal spawn. The two
opening tiles are not counted as rounds. Play continues after the 2048 tile.

| Result | Value | Evidence and scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Minimum rounds to 131072 from two initial 4s | **32,781** | Lean-kernel-checked witness and matching lower bound. |
| Minimum rounds from every other ordinary opening | **32,782** | Lean-kernel-checked all-opening theorem; all **480** labeled opening boards are covered. |
| Minimum endpoint mass when reaching 131072 | **131,102** | Lean-kernel-checked lower bound and joint time/mass attainment for every opening. |
| Full chain, 131072 through 4 on one board | **65,533 rounds** | Replayed construction and written minimum-round argument; at least **320** distinct labeled endpoints, not an exhaustive classification. |
| Shipped high-score construction | **3,925,224 points** | Independently replayed legal game. The manuscript's **3,932,100** ceiling is an upper bound whose attainment is not established here. |
| Continued 4×4 state space | **≤ 22,851,583,961,907,351,152 labeled boards** | Written necessary-condition proof and independent exact-integer counters; not the exact reachable count. |
| State space modulo square symmetries | **≤ 2,856,448,098,561,271,997 classes** | Burnside-counted upper bound under the same necessary conditions. |

The largest-tile upper bound of **131072** is supported by a written rank-envelope
argument; its **attainability** is separately established by the checked witness.
The upper-bound argument is not presented as a Lean theorem.

See the [formal theorem statements](lean-kernel/README.md),
[extremal deductions](research/DEDUCTIONS.md),
[state-space proofs](research/state-space/PROOFS.md), and
[manuscript scope](paper/README.md). Exact definitions and theorem statements,
not interface labels, determine what has been proved.

## Run the demonstration

The application is static: no application server, account, or JavaScript build
step is required. To serve a local checkout, use Python 3:

```sh
git clone --branch gh-pages https://github.com/DomTheDeveloper/2048.git
cd 2048
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Use HTTP rather than opening `index.html` directly,
so the worker and local assets are served consistently.

The demonstration distinguishes ordinary random spawning, an adversarial
spawner, and controlled certificate playback. Undo-assisted replay is a separate
mode and is not an ordinary no-undo game. The high-score playback is a specific
construction, not a certified globally optimal policy. See the
[user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for controls and interpretation.

## Verify a result independently

Python 3 and Node.js are sufficient to replay the main certificate:

```sh
python3 verify/verify2048.py witness/131072.txt
node test/replay_engine.js witness/131072.txt
```

Both checks must report **32,781** verified steps, **131072** as the maximum tile,
zero illegal moves or spawns, and `Certificate: VALID`.

The Python checker implements the slide rules twice and compares the results
at every move. The JavaScript checker loads the original-derived game engine;
it does not import the AI or the Python checker. Both validate the witness
format, opening cells, coordinates, and spawn values before accepting a game.
Replaying a witness proves that trajectory is legal; it does **not** by itself
prove a universal upper or lower bound.

For the full formal development, install the pinned **Lean 4.19.0** toolchain:

```sh
bash lean-kernel/check.sh       # original witness and minimum-round theorems
bash research/finish.sh full    # also all-opening, mass, and deadline results
```

No Mathlib is required for `lean-kernel/`. Certificate generation is untrusted:
the generated transition proofs are checked by the Lean kernel. The original
reachability theorem has no axiom dependencies; the exact-optimum theorem uses
only Lean's standard `propext` and `Quot.sound`. The
[axiom audit](lean-kernel/AUDIT.md) documents the trust boundary. The historical
`lean/` prototype is not the evidence for these claims.

Additional checks:

```sh
python3 test/release_checks.py
node test/paper_facts.js
bash research/finish.sh --computations-only
bash research/state-space/run.sh --large
```

The computational-only command does not run Lean and cannot establish a fresh
kernel audit. The [reproduction guide](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) explains
requirements, output files, audit scope, browser checks, and manuscript builds.
